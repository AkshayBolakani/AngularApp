# AngularApp
BookArt is an Angular App where users can search books from the "Books View" and add them to kart. 
When you add books to the kart, they automatically go to the "Kart View".
The "Book View" and "Kart View" are partials which are used to build this Single Page Application using the principles of
Routing in AngularJS.
Both "Book View" and "Kart View" have their own controllers and there are factories (services) to share code.
In this app for now the data is hard-coded in the factory for easy demonstration purposes.
