AngularApp

BookArt is an Angular App where users can search books from the "Books View" and add them to kart. When you add books to the kart, they automatically go to the "Kart View". The "Book View" and "Kart View" are partials which are used to build this Single Page Application using the principles of Routing in AngularJS. Both "Book View" and "Kart View" have their own controllers and there are factories (services) to share code. In this app for now the data is hard-coded in the factory for easy demonstration purposes.

The main HTML page is the WelcomePage.html and the 2 other HTML pages are in the partials folder. There is an app.js JavaScript file and also an app.css CSS file. The images stored are in the imgs folder.

I also used filters to represent the text in a particular format like the currency is displayed in "$" and the book binding appears in Uppercase.

I also used some CSS transitions to animate my Angular App.

Hope i have given a good idea of all the core concepts used in AngularJS.

This can be run on WebStorm.

Thanks :)
